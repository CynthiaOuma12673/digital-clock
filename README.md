### Digital Clock
This is a simple digital clock implemented using HTML and JavaScript. It displays the current time in a 12-hour format (HH:MM:SS AM/PM) and updates every second.

## Structure

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the digital_clock.html file in a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge).

3. The digital clock will be displayed on the web page, and it will continuously update every second to show the current time.

## How It Works
The digital clock is implemented using HTML and JavaScript. Here's how it works:

- The JavaScript code retrieves the current time using the Date object.
- It then formats the time to display it in a 12-hour format (HH:MM:SS AM/PM).
- The formatted time is displayed on the web page inside a <div> element with the ID "digital-clock."
- To keep the clock continuously updating, a setTimeout function is used to call the clock update function every second.
- Development Environment
- Programming Languages: HTML, JavaScript
- Web Browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge (Recommended)
- Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, Linux
